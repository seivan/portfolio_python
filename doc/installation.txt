Portfolio has been tested on both OS X Leopard and Debian.

You are required to have:
Python - http://www.python.org
python2.5 - An interactive high-level object-oriented language (version 2.5)

Apache2 - http://www.apache.org/
apache2 - Next generation, scalable, extendable web server

mod_python - http://httpd.apache.org/modules/python-download.cgi
libapache2-mod-python - Apache 2 module that embeds Python within the server

Kid-Templating - http://www.kid-templating.org/
python-kid - simple Pythonic template language for XML based vocabularies

Our recomendation is to run this on Debian, then you can just 
use apt-get to #get all required applications.
This installation manual will explain how to install and configure it to work
with Debian, but most *nix systems are similar and the manual can easily
be adapted to other systems.

First get python by typing:
apt-get install python

Apache2
apt-get install apache2

Kid-templating
apt-get install kid

mod_python
apt-get install libapache2-mod-python


Configure Apache

Start of with creating a virtual host by copying
/etc/apache2/sites-available/default 
and rename the new file to 
/etc/apache2/sites-available/portfolio

Now edit it with your favourite editor
and do the following changes:

Remove NameVirtualHost * 

add 'ServerName portfolio' in one of the directives, under the first <VirtualHost *> 

Lets tell apache where our portfolio is by changing
/var/www 
to something where MyPortFolio is located eg
/home/<user>/MyPortfolio
Make sure that MyPortFolio is there, otherwise make that directory
Change that in both document root and directory

We also need to add the support for python by adding the following lines under the directory
SetHandler mod_python 
PythonHandler mod_python.publisher 
PythonDebug On

Now we don't want mod_python to handle everything with PythonHandler.
Some files, eg picture files such as .jpg and .png are files that Apache should handle instead.
Therefor add these following lines

<FilesMatch "\.(gif|html|jpg|jpeg|png|css)$"> 
     SetHandler default-handler 
</FilesMatch> 

You could add other file-exetensions there as well

Now we need Debian to know about our new Virtual Host.
Edit /etc/hosts and add:

127.0.0.1 	localhost portfolio

And activate this new host by typing this command in the terminal
a2ensite portfolio

And then restart Apache
/etc/init.d/apache2 restart

Now if MyPortFolio combined with the 'web' folder is in /home/<user>/ you should be able to see the pagein your browser.
